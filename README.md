# Global-Terrorism
This is a typical Machine Learning Project for which I had used Global Terrorism dataset available on Kaggle to study the trend of terrorism around the globe. As any other ML project, this project consisted of data cleaning, EDA, Statistical Analysis, feature engineering, data visualization, model building and testing. Firstly, I had performed data visualizations using several python libraries in order to answer questions such as trend of terrorism from year to year, countries having the highest terrorism rates, most active terrorist groups, the types of weapon used etc. Moreover, I had used Supervised Learning Classification method to determine if an event in the Global Terrorism database can be classified as exclusively terrorist or other forms of crime. For this, I used several classification algorithms to find the model which performs best on the dataset.
